SQLServerDashboard
==================

SQL Server Dashboard (SSD) is a small website that shows the performance & problems of SQL Server instance and its databases in nearreal time. It uses the SQL Server Performance Dynamic Management Views (DMV) and gathers useful data from the over verbose output from those views, combining them with utility stored procs to get meaningful data out of them.
